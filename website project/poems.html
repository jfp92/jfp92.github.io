                The panda’s unwillingness to breed <br> Is seen by many as a selfish deed <br> We work so hard to facilitate <br> A chance for them to rehabilitate <br> Their dwindling numbers, but with impunity <br> They decide to decline the opportunity
                <br> And we just cannot work out why <br> They won’t go forth and multiply <br> We bemoan and decry: “How deplorable <br> To lose a creature so adorable.” <br> (Which is maybe why we don’t see a reason <br> To rescue those less aesthetically
                pleasin’) <br> But have we ever stopped to think <br> As the panda teeters on the brink <br> That it’s seen the future of the planet: <br> It’s had its race and already ran it <br> And was able therefore to intuit <br> It’s best to not
                bring kids in to it <br> Some selfish behaviour indeed <br> The panda’s unwillingness to breed! <br>

        <article class="poem">
            <p id="op">
                In a rather normal reef <br> Near where the shoreline ends <br> An Oyster and a Phalarope <br> Became the closest friends. <br>
                <br> All who saw them thought the two <br> A quite peculiar pair <br> But each day where the Oyster sat <br> The Phalarope was there. <br>
                <br> The Oyster, mute, the Phalarope <br> Conversed enough for two <br> Her friends, confused, would ask her “what <br> On earth do oysters do? <br>
                <br> “Can he navigate the waves <br> Or frolic in the sun? <br> A shiny pearl he holds within <br> But pearls of wisdom, none.” <br>
                <br> The songbirds warbled their disdain <br> The seabirds wondered why <br> All day she chirped and cheeped away <br> Expecting no reply. <br>
                <br> “We birds can soar to dizzy heights <br> And swim the ocean blue <br> But what, dear Phalarope, oh what <br> On earth do oysters do? <br> “Can he hold you through the dark <br> Or sing the morning’s name? <br> Aren’t the days and
                weeks and months <br> Spent by his side the same? <br>
                <br> “If you choose to spread your wings <br> The wide world waits for you <br> But what, dear Phalarope, oh what <br> On earth do oysters do?” <br>
                <br> One day, at last, the Phalarope <br> Said in reply these words: <br> “Before you sits a creature who’s <br> The happiest of birds. <br>
                <br> “So why do oysters have to DO <br> Such things to prove their worth, <br> If where he IS I’m happier <br> Than any place on earth? <br>
                <br> “I don’t need to swim to sea <br> Or feel my wings unfurled <br> The world may be my oyster but <br> This oyster is my world.”

                Once I hurtled ever on <br> Twisting here and thither <br> Once I rumbled and I rolled <br> Once I was the river <br>

                <br> Once great men observed and wrote <br> Each one doubting never <br> That while man stumbles and he fails <br> I’d go on forever <br> They dreamed of all I’d oversee <br> With nature’s right divine <br> To watch unmoved and unperturbed
                <br> The unfurling grand design <br>
                <br> They thought of soldiers, writers, kings <br> Who’d, come their hour, be gone <br> While beyond love and loss and life <br> I’d journey ever on <br>
                <br> And so I’d flow forevermore <br> Thunderous and vast <br> My watch I’d keep and keep long after <br> Man had breathed his last <br>
                <br> But I have seen the will of man <br> That blinds his doubts to whether <br> That right divine might not be his <br> To journey on forever <br>
                <br> For great men made me promise that <br> Which I cannot deliver <br> Man has come and man goes on <br> Where once I was the river

        <article class="poem">
            <p id="pof">
                Out of all the Animals he had grown up with, Poffidge had once feared the Alligators the most. As a <br>young being, new to the gift of life, their fearsome teeth, and the deathly deeds that he saw <br>performed using them, sent shivers
                down his spine. The deafening hisses that thundered out of their <br>foul nostrils rattled his eardrums and turned his stomach. <br>
                <br> But as he grew up, he soon realised if he simply allowed the Alligators to Alligate, there was really <br>nothing he needed to fear from them. <br>
                <br> What does it mean to Alligate? Well you see, killing and eating is really only a small part of what an <br>Alligator does in a typical day. Their cavernous maws spend far more time chirping witty back-and-<br>forths at each other
                than they do chomping down on food. And as Poffidge walked across the <br>outskirts of the balmy United Reptilian Territories, such mischievous cheeps could be heard. <br>
                <br> “Who has stenched up our swamp?” cawed one beast. <br>
                <br> “If you have to ask, Yannick,” replied another, “you already know.” <br>
                <br> “I beg your pardon, Saoirse?” <br>
                <br> “Oh, do ignore Saoirse,” a third voice, that of Daisy-Mark Van der Merwe, offered, “she is diluting <br>your mind with nonsense to distract you from the fact that this is unmistakably HER stench!” <br>
                <br> “How dare you?!” trumpeted the accused Saoirse. “I will not stand for such baseless Alligations.” <br>
                <br> By way of coincidence, the local doo-wop vocal group were also called the Alligations, and, being <br>exclusively populated by higher register singers, the Alligations were currently rather bassless. <br>Before long the conversation
                turned to this predicament. <br>
                <br> “We need to convince Stankovic to join us,” was the suggestion of Yannick. <br>
                <br> “Stankovic the Bullfrog?!” Daisy-Mark Van der Merwe blurted in reply. “I think you’ll find him quite amphibious.” <br>
                <br> “Amphibious he may be, but no one can hit the low notes quite like him,” Saoirse added. <br>
                <br> “Here he comes now!” a fourth voice bellowed, quite tremendously. “Probably delivering Old Lady <br> Delilah her daily medicine. I don’t see the harm in asking him to join us in song.” <br>
                <br> “Stankovic, good fellow! Care to join us in a round of Scaly Baby?” <br>
                <br> And so the Bassless Alligations erupted in their popular, but thus far vocally incomplete, Alligator <br>Song. Only this time they were joined by the sonorous tones of Stankovic the Bullfrog, who (an <br>Alligator though he wasn’t),
                being possessed of ears and great taste, knew the tune all too well. <br>
                <br> "Oh, scaly baby, put your snout on mine <br>We’ll slide on through the soupy swamp <br> Won’t that be just fine? <br> You’re a one in a million reptilian, though silly and smelly you may be <br>So say that you’ll be my <br>(And please
                don’t ask me why) <br>Be my B-A-B-Y <br>Scaly bay-ay-ay-ay-ayyyyy-byyyyyy!" <br>
                <br> “I didn’t really relate to that song at all,” Stankovic announced above the chuffed mutual <br> congratulating of the Alligations. “I don’t have scales, I tend not to swim in the swamp, and I’m <br>somewhat of a lone wolf personally.”
                <br>
                <br> As a dozen or so concerned Alligator eyes turned to regard him - the contented murmurings <br>immediately silenced - he paused briefly before continuing. <br>
                <br> “But I can tell it’s important to you. So I will do it. I will be your bass singer.” <br>
                <br> That was how Scaly Baby came to be perfected. It went to number one in the Gator Charts, although <br> being the only tune that the Alligators knew rendered it simultaneously the worst song in Recorded <br> Alligator History. Just
                don’t mention that if you happen to be passing a swamp.
