        <p id="about">A young man residing in Aldershot <br> Was upwardly thoroughly fed <br> So decided to give going bald a shot <br> And shaved all the hair from his head <br>
            <br> He took to the woods for to forage <br> For all the good earth could supply <br> He found rivers that bubbled with porridge <br> And Stilton that rained from the sky <br>
            <br> For friendship he had but a leopard <br> Who left him to head for the hills <br> His wounds, not just salted, were peppered <br> But time – so they say – heals all ills <br>
            <br> He walked on the moon’s white reflection <br> That sits on the top of the sea <br> And sighed with an upward inflection <br> “How wondrous it is to be me…” <br>
            <br> He lives on the neverest never <br> With none of his manifold friends <br> He reckons he’ll go on forever <br> But this story, like everything, ends.</p>
