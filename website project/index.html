        <p>Welcome to my website. I've collated a selection of my animal/nature poems in one place and given it a garish colour scheme. <br>
            <br>They were mainly written for an audience of one: my best friend Beth. Now with the help of the World Wide Web I may be looking at doubling, maybe even tripling, my reach. <br>
            <br>Some of them were written when I was much younger. Some of them were from so long ago that it felt like I was stealing from an entirely different person, so they were axed. <br>
            <br>Click the Poems link in the search bar to find the selection. <br>
            <br>Happy reading.
